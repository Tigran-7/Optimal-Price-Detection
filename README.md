# Optimal-Price-Detection
This project is the solution to the Final Project of the Machine Learning Bootcamp 2024, focused on optimal price detection for billboards.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to determine the optimal weekly price for each billboard owned by Bilboardly for the first week of 2024. This optimization task aims to maximize the revenue generated from the billboards based on historical booking data spanning from 2013 to 2023.

## Solution Details
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The solution is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`Optimal_Price_Detection.ipynb`).
- **Modeling Approach**: The solution employs a neural network-based approach to predict the optimal prices for the billboards.
- **Output File**: The output of the solution is stored in the `output_benchmark_data.csv` file, which contains the calculated optimal prices for the first week of 2024.

## Repository Structure
- `Optimal_Price_Detection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the project solution.
- `output_benchmark_data.csv`: Output file containing the optimal prices for the first week of 2024.

## Instructions for Running the Solution
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install Jupyter Notebook if not already installed (`pip install notebook`).
3. Clone this repository to your local machine.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Optimal_Price_Detection.ipynb`.
5. Run the notebook cells to execute the solution.
6. Once executed, the `output_benchmark_data.csv` file will contain the optimal prices.
